Participants : Delano, Jollers(git: joaopaul167) e Volkart.
This project is about a game(hur dur), that we, as old friends from high school, started to think and design, to enhance our skills in game developing and 2D art design. This game
brings simple mechanics of jump and 2D plataform. It's our first project and that is all i can say for now.
CYA :)
